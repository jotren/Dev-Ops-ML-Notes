15. Is a high variance in data good or bad?
16. If your dataset is suffering from high variance, how would you handle it?
17. A data set is given to you about utilities fraud detection. You have built a classifier model and achieved a performance score of 98.5%. Is this a goodmodel? If yes, justify. If not, what can you do about it?
