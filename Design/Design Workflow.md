# Design Workflow

Steps:

1) Define a problem statement that you are trying to solve
1) Define the User Journey from start to finish in your application
2) Sketch every screen out in this user journey, what we feel are the screens for this user journey. Each phase in Journey can have multiple screens
3) Map these screens onto to User Journey to visualise the journey through the users experience. Briefly write what each screen is doing
4) Begin to question every feature that you've created in your screens. Look at every screen adn ask if it is required
5) Code !!!
6) Based on these intial MVPs, begin QA testing: two difference types of testing:
    - Tasked Based Testing: Sitting on the call and asking the user what the task is and ask them to achieve a task
    - Solo Based Testing: Give the user a task and leave them to complete the task
7) If feedback on this testing, go back to step (2) to re look at the process
8) Once passed, bugs have been removed and design improvements have been implemented test externally
