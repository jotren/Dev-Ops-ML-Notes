# SQL Setup #

In order to create a new local version of SQL, we need to download a database. This can be done [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) on Microsofts website. You want to download the Developer free version.

This will allow you to host a server on your local machine for various projects. You can then connect to this database when opening SSMS and browsing for more local servers

This will then connect using the Microsoft Authentication which is a built in process that gives you easy access to these databases when on your computer. The challenege comes when we need to access this database from a different computer or program.
